                    The High/Low app allows for two different ways of entering High/Lows: public and private.

                    When you create a public High/Low, everyone can see it, including people who are not in your friends list.

                    You may wish for them not to be able to see some of your High/Lows. In that case, you can use the private mode.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Private High/Lows are visible only to you (with the exceptions described in our <a href="../privacy/index.html">privacy policy</a>).

                    Friends will not be notified when you create a private High/Low. It will not show up in feeds or in your profile.

                    You can make private High/Lows public at any time (and vice versa).
