                <h1>Sign in with Apple isn't working</h1>
                <p>
                    Sign in with Apple is a new feature with iOS 13 that allows you to create an account with more privacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the privacy features that Apple has put into this button is that <b>they only share your email and name with us once.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While on the surface, this might seem like a good feature, it means that <b>if you attempt to sign in with apple,
                    but registration fails (i.e., if you aren't connected to the internet), we are unable to register an account for you</b>,
                    but Apple doesn't give us a second chance at getting the information and creating an account for you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We try to accommodate this as best we can by saving your email and first name on-device if an error occurs during signup, but this doesn't always work.
                </p>
                <h2>How can I fix it?</h2>
                <p>

                    Fortunately, <b>this problem is fixable!</b>.
                    All you have to do is go to <code>Settings > (Your Name) > Password & Security > Apps Using Your Apple ID > High/Low app</code>, and then tap <b>Stop Using Apple ID</b>.

                </p>

                <p>
                    This will make your iOS device "forget" that you tried to create an account with us, so now you can <b>go back to High/Low and tap "Sign in with apple" again</b>, and your account should be created as normal.
                </p>
