                <p>
                    Many people find themselves unsure when it comes to meditation. It may bring to mind images of Buddhist monks seeking Nirvana. This might make some people uncomfortable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In reality however, meditation is not associated with any one religion - or even religion in general.

                    Meditation can be done in different ways. A Muslim or a Christian might use this time to pray, or perhaps to meditate on a particular passage the scriptures. In High/Low, we provide options for choosing pieces of scripture to meditate on.

                    Meditation can also be a healthy practice for anyone, even if they don't associate themselves with any religion. Many people practice <i>mindfulness meditation</i>, and use the time by focusing on their breath and letting go of distractions.

                    Whoever you are, meditation can be both healthy and enjoyable, so don't be afraid to try  it out!
