                <h1>Unable to log out</h1>
                <p>
                    Under certain circumstances (for example, when you are disconnected from the internet), you may encounter an error saying: <b>"We can't log you out right now due to security issues".</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the error says, <b>we do this for your security and privacy</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The security issue arises from our ability to send you push notifications. For the most part, push notifications can be a helpful way to provide you with the most engaging experience.
                    However, <b>Apple's push notification server identifies your device, not your account with our app</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you agree to receive push notifications, our servers register your device with your account, so we can send the appropriate notifications to you.
                    But, <b>if you log out, and another user logs in</b>, the device is still registered with your account which means <b>the other user will receive your notifications</b>. This is an unacceptable violation of your privacy.

                </p>
                <p>
                    To remedy this situation, <b>we deregister your device when you sign out</b>, so that <b>the other user won't get any of your notifications</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, <b>under some circumstances, we may not be able to connect to the servers, and will not be able to deregister your device</b>.
                    Rather than continuing (and compromising your privacy), <b>we feel it is necessary to keep you from logging out until we can deregister the device</b>.
                </p>
