                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <p>
                  <i>Some information about you may be collected by services supporting our app.
                  Those services are Google App Engine and Google Firebase. The collection of information performed by these services is subject to their privacy policies.</i>

                  We reserve the right to collect usage information on various features of the app.

                  We do not intentionally store, distribute, or otherwise make available any information about users without their permission, other than that pertaining to the usage of the app (including, but not limited to the user's first and last names, email address, and IP address).

                  We use this information to keep track of your activity on the app, to make improvements to the app, and to contact you when necessary.

                  Also, if you decide to participate in any surveys or other activities with us that involve your personal information, we will use only the information provided, and will do our best to make sure it is clear who can see your data.

                  If you have any concerns about the information stored about you on this app, you may contact us through the various methods provided on the website.
                </p>
                <h3>Data Visibility</h3>
                <p>
                  When you create an account on the app, the following information is made publicly visible to all users of the app:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Your first and last names</li>
                    <li>Your profile image (or one created by the app, if one is not provided)</li>
                    <li>Your bio, if provided</li>
                    <li>Your High/Low streak</li>
                    <li>Your interests, as provided</li>
                    <li>The "friends" you've connected with on the app</li>
                    <li>Your public High/Lows, and all the information connected to them (i.e., likes, comments, flags, etc.)
                  </ul>

                  Your private High/Lows are visible only to you and app administrators. App administrators may need to view private High/Lows in order to fix an issue.

                  We take security precautions to keep your email address from being viewed publicly. It will not be intentionally made public.
                </p>
                <h3>Contact</h3>
                <p>
                  By consenting to this privacy policy, you give us the right to contact you via email or other means.

                  We may do this to give you extra content, inform you of deals, update you on changes to the app, or other actions requiring communication.
                </p>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>
                  We do our best to make sure your data is secure and accessible only to the people you allow, under the conditions of this privacy policy.

                  We do not store your passwords, but instead store a hash of your password that we can check against an input.

                  In certain situations, we may prevent you from logging out of the app. This is a security precaution to prevent other users from receiving push notifications from your account.

                  Our API exposes only the information outlined in this document to the public.

                  We have greater access to your data through the API as administrators, and can view all the information the app collects, as outlined in this document.

                  All API requests are SSL-encrypted.

                  Access is granted to your data via a token stored on your device. This token expires after an hour, at which point the app requests a new one using a second token.
                  This means your data is only available to another for up to an hour if the access token is stolen.

                  In the event of a security breach where your information pertaining to this app is stolen, you may contact us as explained on the website. We will do our best to resolve your situation.
                </p>
                <h3>Closing</h3>
                <p>
                  We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time without notice.
